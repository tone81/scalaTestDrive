# Tony's Attempt to learn Scala

I'm finally getting out to Github, and I figured that I would start by putting my first attempts of Scala here.
I have several reasons for learning Scala:

* There's been enough buzz I couldn't ignore it
* My friend and I have have an interesting project where it might fit
* My future company might look down on my project that's in CoffeeScript and Node.js
